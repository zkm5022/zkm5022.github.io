# Full Stack Developer Portfolio
## Zachary Moul 
### Welcome to my Portfolio Page!
#### Hi, my name is Zachary Moul and I am currently a Lead Software Engineer for General Motors.  With a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate degree from Penn State, I saw the need to learn more about the fundamentals of Full Stack Development.  Although there is a lot that can be picked up on the job, I saw the need to learn and discover more to fill the gaps in my education.  Outside of work and classes, I enjoy travelling.  Whethere it's skiing in the winter or a new city in the summer, I look forward to adventure and trying new things.  I also am very involved in fitness and rock climbing.  Please watch the video to learn more about me and continue scrolling to find the projects that I have completed so far.
